    What is a pointer?
    Address     Var Name    Value
    1000
    1004
    1008        num1        22
    1012
    1016
    ....

    Each variable has an address in memory e.g. variable num1 as a memory address of 1008 in the above example.
    This memory address maybe stored in a special variable called a pointer.
    In effect, a pointer is a variable which stores a memory adress. A pointer can,therefore, be used to access the contents of that memory address.
    Pointers are special variables that store the memory adresses of other variables.

    Pointer declaration:
    <type>* <var_name>;
    e.g.
    int* p_var;
    The above is a pointer with name p_var, which points to a memory address of an integer.
    The * between the type and variable/pointer name, tells us and the compiler that it is a pointer.
