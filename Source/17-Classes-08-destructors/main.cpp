    Destructors (21:42:50):
    Destructors are special methods that are called when an object dies. They are needed when the object needs to release some dynamic emory, or for some other kind of clean up.

    When are destructors called?
    Less obvous cases:
        - When an object is passed by value to a function.
        - When a local object is returned from a function.
    More obvious cases:
        - When a local stack object goes out of scope (dies).
        - When a heap object is released with delete.
