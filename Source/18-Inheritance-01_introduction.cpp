    Inheritance (22:52:45):
    -A feature that allows us to build classes in terms of other classes.
    eg.
    class Person -> class Engineer (contains member variables and methods of Person + its own stuff) -> class CivilEng (contains member variables and methods of Engineer + its own stuff)
    So, CivilEng inherits from Engineer, and  Engineer inherits from Person.
    Therefore, CivilEng also inherits from Persom.

    Notes:
    - Inheritance is a defining feature of OBject Orient Programming in C++.
    - Building types on top of other types.
    - Inheritance hierarchies can be setup to suit your needs.
    - Code reused is improved.
