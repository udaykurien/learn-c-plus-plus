    Classes Introduction (20:15:41):
    - A mechanism we have to build our own types (types are things like int and double).
    - We do this by setting up blueprints of our class type.
    - We then use the blueprint (class) to build actual objects.

    eg. Blueprint (class) - Object 1
                          - Object 2
                          - Object 3

    eg. Blueprint (house) - Object 1 (John's house)
                          - Object 2 (Jane's house)
